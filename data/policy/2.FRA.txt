Government of India
Ministry of Tribal Affairs

Guidelines on the implementation of the Scheduled Tribes  
and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) 
Act, 2006

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 
seeks to recognize and vest the forest rights and occupation in forest land in forest dwelling Scheduled 
Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers who have been residing in such forests for generations but 
whose rights could not be recorded. The Act was notified for operation with effect from 31.12.2007 and 
the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Rules, 2008 for 
implementing the provisions of the Act were notified on 1.1.2008.

Over a period of last four years of implementation of the Act, some problems impeding the 
implementation of the Act in its letter and spirit have come to the notice of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 
such as, convening of Gram Sabha meetings at the Panchayat level resulting in exclusion of smaller 
habitations not formally part of any village; non-recognition of un-hindered rights over the minor forest 
produce (MFP) to forest dwellers; non-recognition of other community rights; harassment and eviction 
of forest dwellers without settlement of their forest rights; rejection of claims by insisting on certain 
types of evidences, inadequate awareness about the provisions of the Act and the Rules etc.

In order to address the above concerns and with a view to ensure effective implementation of the Act, 
the following guidelines are issued on various aspects of implementation of the Act for compliance by 
all the State Governments/UT Administrations.

i. Process of Recognition of Rights:

a. The State Governments should ensure that on receipt of intimation from the Forest Rights Committee, 
the officials of the Forest and Revenue Departments remain present during the verification of the 
claims and the evidence on the site. 

b. In the event of modification or rejection of a claim by the Gram Sabha or by the Sub-Divisional Level 
Committee or the District Level Committee, the decision on the claim should be communicated to the 
claimant to enable the aggrieved person to prefer a petition to the Sub-Divisional Level Committee 
or the District Level Committee, as the case may be, within the sixty days period prescribed under 
the Act and no such petition should be disposed of against the aggrieved person, unless he has been 
given a reasonable opportunity to present his case.



38

Forest Rights Act, 2006: Act, Rules and Guidelines

c. The Sub-Divisional Level Committee or the District Level Committee should, if deemed necessary, 
remand the claim to the Gram Sabha for reconsideration instead of rejecting or modifying the same, 
in case the resolution or the recommendation of the Gram Sabha is found to be incomplete or prima-
facie requires additional examination.

d. In cases where the resolution passed by the Gram Sabha, recommending a claim, is upheld by Sub-
Divisional Level Committee, but the same is not approved by the District Level Committee, the 
District Level Committee should record the reasons for not accepting the recommendations of the 
Gram Sabha and the Sub-Divisional Level Committee, in writing, and a copy of the order should be 
supplied to the claimant.

e. On completion of the process of settlement of rights and issue of titles as specified in Annexures II, 
III & IV of the Rules, the Revenue/Forest Departments shall prepare a final map of the forest land so 
vested and the concerned authorities shall incorporate the forest rights so vested in the revenue and 
forest records, as the case may be, within the prescribed cycle of record updation. 

f. All decisions of the Sub-Divisional Level Committee and District Level Committee that involve 
modification or rejection of a Gram Sabha resolution/recommendation should be in the form of 
speaking orders.

g. The Sub-Divisional Level Committee or the District Level Committee should not reject any claim 
accompanied by any two forms of evidences, specified in Rule 13, and recommended by the Gram 
Sabha, without giving reasons in writing and should not insist upon any particular form of evidence 
for consideration of a claim. Fine receipts, encroacher lists, primary offence reports, forest settlement 
reports, and similar documentation rooted in prior official exercises, or the lack thereof, would not be 
the sole basis for rejection of any claim.

h. Use of any technology, such as, satellite imagery, should be used to supplement evidences tendered 
by a claimant for consideration of the claim and not to replace other evidences submitted by him in 
support of his claim as the only form of evidence. 

i. The status of all the claims, namely, the total number of claims filed, the number of claims approved 
by the District Level Committee for title, the number of titles actually distributed, the number 
of claims rejected, etc. should be made available at the village and panchayat levels through  
appropriate forms of communications, including conventional methods, such as, display of notices, 
beat of drum etc.

j. A question has been raised whether the four hectare limit specified in Section 4(6) of the Act, 
which provides for recognition of forest rights in respect of the land mentioned in clause (a) of  
sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Act, applies to other forest rights mentioned in Section 3(1) of 
the Act. It is clarified that the four hectare limit specified in Section 4(6) applies to rights under  
Section 3(1)(a) of the Act only and not to any other right under Section 3(1), such as conversion of 
pattas or leases, conversion of forest villages into revenue villages etc.



39

Forest Rights Act, 2006: Guidelines

ii. Minor Forest Produce: 

a. The State Governments should ensure that the forest rights relating to MFPs under Section 3(1)
(c) of the Act are recognized in respect of all MFPs, as defined under Section 2(i) of the Act, in all 
forest areas, and state policies are brought in alignment with the provisions of the Act. Section 2(i) 
of the Act defines the term “minor forest produce” to include “all non-timber produce of plant origin, 
including bamboo, brush wood, stumps, cane, tussar, cocoons, honey, wax, lac, tendu or kendu 
leaves, medicinal plants and herbs, roots, tubers, and the like”.

b. The monopoly of the Forest Corporations in the trade of MFP in many States, especially in case of 
high value MFP, such as, tendu patta, is against the spirit of the Act and should henceforth be done 
away with. 

c. The forest right holders or their cooperatives/federations should be allowed full freedom to sell such 
MFPs to anyone or to undertake individual or collective processing, value addition, marketing, for 
livelihood within and outside forest area by using locally appropriate means of transport. 

d. The State Governments should exempt movement of all MFPs from the purview of the transit 
rules of the State Government and, for this purpose, the transit rules be amended suitably. Even 
a transit permit from Gram Sabha should not be required. Imposition of any fee/charges/royalties 
on the processing, value addition, marketing of MFP collected individually or collectively by the 
cooperatives/federations of the rights holders would also be ultra vires of the Act.

e. The State Governments need to play the facilitating role in not only transferring unhindered absolute 
rights over MFP to forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers but also in 
getting them remunerative prices for the MFP, collected and processed by them.

iii. Community Rights:

a. The District Level Committee should ensure that the records of prior recorded nistari or other 
traditional community rights (such as Khatian part II in Jharkhand, and traditional forest produce 
rights in Himachal and Uttarakhand) are provided to Gram Sabhas, and if claims are filed for 
recognition of such age-old usufructory rights, such claims are not rejected except for valid reasons, 
to be recorded in writing, for denial of such recorded rights;

b. The District Level Committee should also facilitate the filing of claims by pastoralists before the 
concerned Gram Sabha(s) since they would be a floating population for the Gram Sabha(s) of the 
area used traditionally.

c. In view of the differential vulnerability of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PTGs) amongst the 
forest dwellers, District Level Committee should play a pro-active role in ensuring that all PTGs receive 
habitat rights in consultation with the concerned PTGs’ traditional institutions and their claims for 
habitat rights are filed before the concerned Gram Sabhas.



40

Forest Rights Act, 2006: Act, Rules and Guidelines

d. The forest villages are very old entities, at times of pre-independent era, duly existing in the forest 
records. The establishment of these villages was in fact encouraged by the forest authorities in 
the pre-independent era for availability of labour within the forest areas. The well defined record 
of each forest village, including the area, number of inhabitants, etc. exists with the State Forest 
Departments. There are also unrecorded settlements and old habitations that are not in any 
Government record. Section 3(1)(h) of the Act recognizes the right of forest dwelling Scheduled 
Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers relating to settlement and conversion on forest villages, 
old habitation, un-surveyed villages and other villages and forests, whether recorded, notified or 
not into revenue villages. The conversion of all forest villages into revenue villages and recognition 
of the forest rights of the inhabitants thereof should actually have been completed immediately 
on enactment of the Act. The State Governments may, therefore, convert all such erstwhile forest 
villages, unrecorded settlements and old habitations into revenue villages with a sense of urgency in 
a time bound manner. The conversion would include the actual land-use of the village in its entirety, 
including lands required for current or future community uses, like, schools, health facilities, public 
spaces etc. Records of the forest villages maintained by the Forest Department may thereafter be 
suitably updated on recognition of this right. 

iv. Community Forest Resource Rights:

a. The State Government should ensure that the forest rights under Section 3(1)(i) of the Act relating 
to protection, regeneration or conservation or management of any community forest resource, 
which forest dwellers might have traditionally been protecting and conserving for sustainable use, 
are recognized in all villages and the titles are issued as soon as the prescribed Forms for claiming 
Rights to Community Forest Resource and the Form of Title for Community Forest Resources are 
incorporated in the Rules. Any restriction, such as, time limit, on use of community forest resources 
other than what is traditionally imposed would be against the spirit of the Act. 

b. In case no community forest resource rights are recognized in a village, the reasons for the same 
should be recorded. Reference can be made to existing records of community and joint forest 
management, van panchayats, etc. for this purpose.

c. The Gram Sabha would initially demarcate the boundaries of the community forest resource as 
defined in Section 2(a) of the Act for the purposes of filing claims for recognition of forest right under 
Section 3(1)(i) of the Act. 

d. The Committees constituted under Rule 4(e) of the Forest Rights Rules, 2008 would work under the 
control of Gram Sabha. The State Agencies should facilitate this process.

e. Consequent upon the recognition of forest right in Section 3(i) of the Act to protect, regenerate or 
conserve or manage any community forest resource, the powers of the Gram Sabha would be in 
consonance with the duties as defined in Section 5(d), wherein the Gram Sabha is empowered to 
regulate access to community forest resources and stop any activity which adversely affects the wild 
animals, forest and the bio-diversity. Any activity that prejudicially affects the wild-life, forest and 
bio-diversity in forest area would be dealt with under the provisions of the relevant Acts. 



41

Forest Rights Act, 2006: Guidelines

v. Protection against Eviction, Diversion of Forest Lands and Forced 
Relocation:

a. Section 4(5) of the Act is very specific and provides that no member of a forest dwelling Scheduled 
Tribe or other traditional forest dwellers shall be evicted or removed from the forest land under 
his occupation till the recognition and verification procedure is complete. This clause is of an 
absolute nature and excludes all possibilities of eviction of forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes or other  
traditional forest dwellers without settlement of their forest rights as this Section opens with the 
words “Save as otherwise provided”. The rationale behind this protective clause against eviction is to 
ensure that in no case a forest dweller should be evicted without recognition of his rights as the same 
entitles him to a due compensation in case of eventuality of displacement in cases, where even after 
recognition of rights, a forest area is to be declared as inviolate for wildlife conservation or diverted 
for any other purpose. In any case, Section 4(1) has the effect of recognizing and vesting forest rights 
in eligible forest dwellers. Therefore, no eviction should take place till the process of recognition and 
vesting of forest rights under the Act is complete. 

b. The Ministry of Environment & Forests, vide their letter No.11-9/1998-FC(pt.) dated 30.07.2009, as 
modified by their subsequent letter of the same number dated 03.08.2009, has issued directions, 
requiring the State/UT Governments to enclose certain evidences relating to completion of the 
process of settlement of rights under the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers 
(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, while formulating unconditional proposals for diversion of 
forest land for non-forest purposes under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The State Government 
should ensure that all diversions of forest land for non-forest purposes under the Forest (Conservation) 
Act, 1980 take place in compliance with the instructions contained in the Ministry of Environment & 
Forest’s letter dated 30.07.2009, as modified on 03.08.2009.

c. There may be some cases of major diversions of forest land for non-forest purposes under the Forest 
(Conservation) Act, 1980 after the enactment of the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest 
Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 but before the issue of Ministry of Environment & 
Forests’ letter dated 30.07.2009, referred to above. In case, any evictions of forest dwelling Scheduled 
Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers have taken place without settlement of their rights 
due to such major diversions of forest land under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, the District 
Level Committees may be advised to bring such cases of evictions, if any, to the notice of the State 
Level Monitoring Committee for appropriate action against violation of the provisions contained in  
Section 4(5) of the Act. 

d. The Act envisages the recognition and vesting of forest rights in forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes 
and other traditional forest dwellers over all forest lands, including National Parks and Sanctuaries. 
Under Section 2(b) of the Act, the Ministry of Environment & Forests is responsible for determination 
and notification of critical wildlife habitats in the National Parks and Sanctuaries for the purpose of 
creating inviolate areas for wildlife conservation, as per the procedure laid down. In fact, the rights 
of the forest dwellers residing in the National Parks and Sanctuaries are required to be recognized 
without waiting of notification of critical wildlife habitats in these areas. Further, Section 4(2) of the 
Act provides for certain safeguards for protection of the forest rights of the forest rights holders 
recognized under the Act in the critical wildlife habitats of National Parks and Sanctuaries, when their

rights are either to be modified or resettled for the purposes of creating inviolate areas for wildlife 
conservation. No exercise for modification of the rights of the forest dwellers or their resettlement 
from the National Parks and Sanctuaries can be undertaken, unless their rights have been recognized 
and vested under the Act. In view of the provisions of Section 4(5) of the Act, no eviction and 
resettlement is permissible from the National Parks and Sanctuaries till all the formalities relating to 
recognition and verification of their claims are completed. The State/UT Governments may, therefore, 
ensure that the rights of the forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers, 
residing in National Parks and Sanctuaries are recognized first before any exercise for modification of 
their rights or their resettlement, if necessary, is undertaken and no member of the forest dwelling 
Scheduled Tribe or other traditional forest dweller is evicted from such areas without the settlement 
of their rights and completion of all other actions required under Section 4(2) of the Act.

e. The State Level Monitoring Committee should monitor compliance of the provisions of  
Section 3(1)(m) of the Act, which recognizes the right to in situ rehabilitation including alternative 
land in cases where the forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers have 
been illegally evicted or displaced from forest land without receiving their legal entitlement to 
rehabilitation, and also of the provisions of Section 4(8) of the Act, which recognizes their right to 
land when they are displaced from their dwelling and cultivation without land compensation due to 
State development interventions. 

vi. Awareness-Raising, Monitoring and Grievance Redressal:

a. Each State should prepare suitable communication and training material in local language for 
effective implementation of the Act. 

b. The State Nodal Agency should ensure that the Sub Divisional Level Committee and the District Level 
Committee make district-wise plans for trainings of revenue, forest and tribal welfare departments’ 
field staff, officials, Forest Rights Committees and Panchayat representatives. Public meetings  
for awareness generation in those villages where process of recognition is not complete need  
to be held. 

c. In order to generate awareness about the various provisions of the Act and the Rules, especially the 
process of filing petitions, the State Government should organize public hearings on local bazaar 
days or at other appropriate locations on a quarterly basis till the process of recognition is complete. 
It will be helpful if some members of Sub Divisional Level Committee are present in the public 
hearings. The Gram Sabhas also need to be actively involved in the task of awareness raising.

d. If any forest dwelling Scheduled Tribe in case of a dispute relating to a resolution of a Gram Sabha or 
Gram Sabha through a resolution against any higher authority or Committee or officer or member 
of such authority or Committee gives a notice as per Section 8 of the Act regarding contravention of 
any provision of the Act or any rule made thereunder concerning recognition of forest rights to the 
State Level Monitoring Committees, the State Level Monitoring Committee should hold an inquiry 
on the basis of the said notice within sixty days from the receipt of the notice and take action, if any, 
that is required. The complainant and the Gram Sabha should be informed about the outcome of  
the inquiry.
