CHAPTER XII  

Mining Regulation Portal 

 

73. Mining regulation web portal.– The Indian Bureau of Mines, in consultation 
with the State Governments, shall prepare a mining regulation web portal to bring 

information together the different aspects of the regulatory functions being undertaken 

by the Indian Bureau of Mines and the State Government or the authorised officer of 

the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, as the case may be, for 

implementation and compliance of the provisions of these rules.  

 

74. Recording of regulatory functions.– All aspects of regulatory functions being 
undertaken by the Indian Bureau of Mines or the State Government or the authorised 

officer of the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, as the case 

may be, for implementation and compliance of the provisions of these rules shall be 

recorded in standard process sheets or templates developed for these purposes, and the 

information in this regard shall be made available on the portal referred to in rule 73: 

 

Provided that access to the commercial information provided in the said web 

portal shall be so regulated that the information is accessible only by the holder of the 

mineral concession concerned, the Controller General, the Central Government, the 

State Government, the authorised officer and the administrator of the web portal.

75. Information source.–(1) Each information source shall have a dedicated area on 
the page for displaying information (a portlet). 

 

Explanation.–For the purposes of this rule, it is clarified that inspections carried out by 

the Indian Bureau of Mines or the State Government or an authorised officer of the 

Director, Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, as the case may 

be, and the response of the mine owner or manager to the inspection shall be construed 

as one information source.   

 

(2) Identification of the different information sources, user categories, preparation of 

the standard process sheets or templates, configuring and customizing the presentation 

of the content and other details in this regard as well the role of the administrator for 

addition of information to the portal or deletion from the portal shall be decided by the 

Controller General in consultation with the Central Government.
