environmental-conflict-tracker
==============================

Scrape news media articles to identify environmental conflict events such as resource conflict, land appropriation, human-wildlife conflict, and supply chain conflict.

This pipeline involves the following steps:

1.  Pulling all news data in a given country that contains a conflict event
2.  Keyword extraction of candidate articles from titles of news articles based on regular expression matches to a curated dictionary
3.  Scraping of full news media text for candidate articles with `NewsPlease`
4.  Using gold standard dataset to be stored in `data/processed/$MONTH/$NAME.txt` to generate a classifier
5.  Generating maps of conflict events with GDELT geolocation and leaflet
