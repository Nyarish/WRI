The underlying technology blockchain will most certainly survive and is bound to make inroads in every sector. Even though the blockchain revolution started from banking and finance industry, other industries like healthcare, energy, retail, governance, supply chain and agriculture are going to be disrupted by blockchain application. What is blockchain and why is it unique? The underlying technology blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows all members to record transactions in a decentralised data log maintained on a network of computers, rather than a physical ledger or a single database. Transactions must be approved through consensus, and everything is secured through cryptography. In simpler terms think of blockchain as google sheets versus excel sheet sent through emails. In google sheets, all members have live access to Data and can independently record/track the updates of every entry being made. Add another layer on top of this, where entry once made is recorded permanently and cannot be edited or erased by any member.',\n",

(Image: PTI) Budget 2018: Even as the date for Union Budget 2018 nears, and the government looks to augment tax revenues by widening the tax base, a pertinent question to be asked is whether FM Arun Jaitley FM Arun Jaitley look to bring agriculture income under the tax net? “Prima facie, philosophically it is a great idea, but it is all about the timing. Would the government want to go ahead and impose this levy in a pre-election year? In addition, there are sensitivities of farmers also involved,” Abhay Laijawala, Head – India Research, Deutsche Equities said in an interview to CNBC TV18. The expert pointed out that there has been a lot of distress in the agriculture space, leaving little room for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to bring agriculture income under the tax net in the upcoming Union Budget 2018. “Clearly over the last three years we have seen acute rural distress and if the government goes ahead and instead of resolving acute rural distress is seen imposing a tax on agriculture, politically there would be a very low political threshold for the same,” Abhay Laijawala told the channel.

Parathasarathi has said. Stating that the main objective for conducting the exercise for purification of land records was to implement the investment support scheme, wherein the farmers are proposed to be given ₹4,000 per acre per agriculture season, Mr. Parthasarathi told Joint Collectors, Revenue Divisional Officers and District Agriculture Officers that issuance of new pattadar passbooks-cum-title deeds and extending investment support would be based on the land data being compiled by the Revenue Department. Holding a video conference from the Secretariat on Tuesday, the Agriculture Production Commissioner said since the investment support would be given in the form of cheques, care has to be taken so that farmers' information in passbooks and cheques match. He told Revenue Divisional Officers and District Agriculture Officers that the investment support scheme taken up by the Telangana Government for the first time in the country is being watched by the Centre, other States and policy makers. He stressed the need to compile error-free and factual information on mandals, villages, farmers' account numbers and extent of land holding by holding gram sabhas in villages as the date would hold key for several other needs in future. He stated that preparation of agriculture budget would also be based on the data. He told the Joint Collectors to involve the Agriculture Department officers from Agriculture Extension Officer level to District Agriculture Officer in the compilation of land data. Director of Land Administration V. Karuna stated that compilation of 93% land data was completed so far and the remaining database including rectification of mistakes, if any, would be completed by the month-end.

This report primarily targets stakeholders in the farming sector which include contract farming / value chain promoters, farmer’s producer organizations and farmers as well as other citizens of the country for farmer’s producer organizations and farmers as well as other citizens of the country views and comments on the same. To understand what it entails we must first understand the concept of Contract Farming. In recent times agriculture has undergone tremendous shift in terms of how the occupation in the occupation in itself is viewed and the social relations that the occupation in itself entails. With introduction of challenges such as pressure on land, climate change and the response advent of new technologies, agriculture undoubtedly is in the cusp of a new beginning. This is the background in which the concept of contract farming can be best explained. In contract farming, a company or an organisation enters into an agreement with a farmer. In an agreement with a farmer a farmer is given pre-decided support for agriculture while a farmer assures crops at a pre-decided price and quality. In this process, the farmers are given every possible help by way of seeds, fertilisers etc by the company so that a farmer can produce the desired results. The rationale behind the emergence of such a system was predominantly to cash in on the increasing opportunities provided in the agricultural sector while protecting a farmer from price shocks at the same time. In fact, as repeated incidents have proved, the volatility of prices hit the farmers much more that the farmers hit the consumers. Companies are also saved from price volatility due to assurance of availability of raw materials.',\n",

Vedanta group chairman Anil Agarwal has suggested that resolution of the issue will address concerns of global investors although government has maintained that government does not intend to use the law retrospectively.Agarwal, whose group deals in natural resources has demanded changes in policies related to sectors Agarwal companies operate in, arguing that whose group will benefit SMEs and enhance domestic economic activity.“The new policies on exploration need to address the core issues. For example, Cairn India cannot meet Cairn India target of producing 300 million tonnes of steel, if we continue to have caps on the production of iron ore. This necessitates the import of iron ore, thereby leading to the outgo of precious foreign exchange,” the letter said.Similarly, Agarwal has pitched for the removal of the 20% cess on domestic crude oil, which argued that imported crude oil is not taxed. “We hope it can be brought down to a realistic level, say under 10%,” Agarwal said.Further, Agarwal said, Cairn India has one of the highest bauxite reserves and the mines can be auctioned on the basis of available data as in the case of oil & gas sector under OLAP so that the demand can be met by domestic production.

Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy noted that an agreement was signed by the two governments in 1961 to share water from Veedur dam to meet the irrigation requirements of farmers in Mannadipet constituency in the union territory. The deal ensured availability of water for Puducherry for 175 days to enable farmers here to get water for cultivation on an extent of 1400 hectares from Veedur dam, Puducherry said. \"The release of water for Mannadipet block was stopped this year.. Our plea is that the agreement should be enforced by the Tamil Nadu authorities,\" Puducherry said adding a letter would be shot off to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu seeking immediate release of water in keeping with the provisions of the agreement. Veedur dam is situated in the catchment areas of Varaha river and Thondiaru in Villupuram district and had been a source of irrigation for farm lands in Mannadipet constituency in Puducherry. \"Besides, Tamil Nadu government was ignoring the Union Territorys share of 6 tmc feet of water released into the Cauvery basin by Tamil Nadu government,\" Narayanasamy alleged.

The scientists, led by Uma Ramakrishnan, geneticist, at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru chose the central India Landscape, where 11 Protected Areas, including Kanha, Bandavgarh and Pench, are located. India is home to 65 per cent of the world’s wild tigers and India has a central role to play in conserving the big cat. India is also a party to the St Petersburg declaration of 2010, which propounded doubling tiger numbers across the nations.',\n",

Sounds one for Hercule Poirot A team of investigators is using forensic science and behavioural analysis to identify which of two snarling leopards now locked up at Van Vihar national park killed three children just beyond the outskirts of the state capital last week. Samples of excreta and saliva of two snarling leopards have been collected to match forensic evidence collected from the bodies of those killed on three consecutive nights in Obaidullahganj , some 35km from BHOPAL.two snarling leopards were captured within a radius of 50 metres in a span of 24 hours on March 23 and brought to Van Vihar. “two snarling leopards two snarling leopards are ferocious and it is difficult to make out which is the culprit,” investigating officer SDO Rajeev Shrivastava told TOI.Shrivastava and TOI.Shrivastava team haven’t ruled out the possibility of a conspiracy — two snarling leopards may be to blame. And the biggest hurdle for the jungle detectives is the same one that often dogs police: a messed-up crime scene.‘Both two snarling leopards are ferocious’Shrivastava said, “Due to destruction of evidence on the spot by villagers, our only hope are the samples of saliva and excreta of the two leopards. If these match those collected from the bodies and around the kills, our’ll know which leopard killed these match those collected from the bodies and around the kills.” The samples were sent to FSL Jabalpur on March 25.The first kill took place on the intervening night of March 17-18 in which a 12-year-old boy was mauled to death by a leopard in Bagdihi. “Villagers were the first to reach the spot by villagers and carry away the body, thus destroying evidence,” said investigating officer SDO Rajeev Shrivastava, adding that officials were looking for hair of the big cat, which might have been shed during the attack, but the entire area was trampled by villagers. The locals did it out of ignorance.Barely 24 hours after the child’s death, the mangled body of an 18-year-old girl was found in Dagdaga village of Obaidullahganj, just 2km from the previous kill. Villagers chased the beast away which left teenager’s bleeding body. teenager died within seconds. A third attack was reported on March 19 in Khidki Ghati village.The next day, forest officials trapped a leopard near the Bagdihi scene of crime. forest officials thought forest officials work was over until forest officials chanced upon pugmarks of another leopard in the vicinity. A frantic search ensued. the entire area was cordoned off, and on March 22, a leopard near the Bagdihi scene of crime was caught. The first one was brought to Van Vihar on March 21, and the second one on March 23.The forest department is also studying the behavioural pattern of both animals to see if both animals can identify any telltale signs. The profiling will be carried out over 20 days, sources said. Dr Shrivastava, who has been closely observing the behaviour of the two leopards, said Dr Shrivastava, who has been closely observing the behaviour of the two leopards are ferocious. “An analyst will be within sight of the two leopards continuously for a minimum 20 days,” said an official, explaining that this will help graph the behavioural movement of the beasts. “If any of the two leopards mellows during the course of study, any of the leopards mellows during the course of study will be absolved from guilt. On the other hand, if a leopard remains ferocious all through, a leopard may be an indication that any of the leopards mellows during the course of study sees humans as prey,” an official said, adding that it is not foolproof deduction, and humans are banking on DNA analysis.the second one on March 23.The forest department found guilty will have to spend the rest of the second one on March 23.The forest department life at Van Vihar. the second one on March 23.The forest department will be freed in the wild.

And Gujarat will only worsen in the next two months as the State’s main water sources like the Narmada dam, and dozens of other dams and reservoirs, are going dry. Ironically, Gujarat is faced with the crisis despite copious rains last monsoon. Gujarat has assured that there will be no shortage of drinking water in any corner of the State. Narmada water was stopped for irrigation from March 15. Water Resources and Irrigation Minister Parbat Patel recently told the Assembly that the State has made adequate arrangements to ensure drinking water is available in every part of the State. But the picture is far from that. A crisis is already evident in villages, where water is now supplied once or twice a week. Despite the the State’s claimed preparations, approximately 4,238 out of 18,000 villages in Gujarat are facing a severe crisis as 18,000 villages in Gujarat sources have either gone dry or are about to go dry. “More than 50% of the hand pumps in tribal pockets are not functional. Small tribal villages from north to Gujarat Gujarat are the worst hit,” said Congress spokesman Manish Doshi. Currently, the water level in the State’s main water body, the Sardar Sarovar dam on Narmada, is at about 105 metres, roughly less than 50% of the dam’s normal average level. Moreover, the spread of water in the reservoir, which was across 214 km during the monsoon, has now shrunk to less than 90 km, and will shrink further in the summer. Now, the State is forced to use the dead stock of water from the dam.',\n",

The area comprises of gentle to steep slopes and supports a huge biodiversity of flora and fauna. Population growth has resulted in expansion of human areas and consequently diversion of forest lands for development projects such as roads, railway lines, transmission lines, reservoirs for irrigation and power projects, etc. Forests are also denuded and degraded due to heavy anthropogenic pressure of encroachments, grazing, forest fires, illicit cutting of trees for timber, poles and firewood, and illegal collection of non-timber forest products (NTFP) and medicinal plants. The Forest Rights Act 2006, to safeguard the rights of scheduled tribes and other forest dwellers, was enacted with good intent, but the implementation was tardy as officers came under pressure to accept all claims. In forested districts like North Kanara, Haveri, Kodagu and Shimoga, there was aggressive clearing of forest growth. The communities had the patronage of political masters. Politicians conducted public meetings and encouraged villagers to clear more and more forests and claim title. When the cases were rejected by Deputy Commissioners, the cases were pressured. Forest officers were silent spectators as tree-growth clearing continued unabated. Areas, where encroachments were evicted, were reoccupied and titles were claimed. It may be time to take a relook at the Forest Rights Act. The Karnataka (Preservation) of Trees Act was meant to regulate permissions for tree-felling on private lands in the Western Ghats. Not all wooded areas were reserved. Vast stretches, especially in Chikkamagaluru, Hassan and Kodagu districts, were under the control of the Revenue Department. Kodagu district had a number of confusing land tenures; officers, politicians and timber merchants have enjoyed this confusion. Some areas were encroached and much more were allotted for coffee cultivation. Wooded areas lost Wooded areas character as varieties of timber species were extracted by merchants. Coffee plantations have now a monoculture of silver oak trees. A series of reports by the French Institute of Pondicherry suggest that Kodagu district lost 30% of tree cover between 1967 and 2007. The granting of tree-felling permission on steep slopes in hilly districts is the reason for the flood and landslides that Kodagu faced recently.',\n",

Jagdishpur lake, the largest reservoir in Nepal, and one of the ten wetlands in the country listed under the Ramsar Convention is home to about 23,000 birds according to the latest survey — probably the largest single avian population in the country listed under the Ramsar Convention.

In the early 70s, the reservoir was built to irrigate adjoining paddy fields and later expanded to 225 hectares. This became one of the best habitats for endemic and migratory birds. However, locals were not aware of This importance until recently. “People used to think that these birds come every year, so what’s wrong with killing People for meat?” added Khan. This all changed when the local communities came together to control such activities a few years ago. But the poaching hasn’t stopped completely. “Some people still kill birds. If asked not to, then Some people threaten us and say [the birds] are public property,” Chaudhary said. Weighty wetlands According to the Ramsar Convention, 2,293 lakes are listed as wetlands of international importance globally, covering 230 million hectares. Listed as the richest ecosystems on earth after tropical rainforests, wetlands of international importance support wild animals and plants, some of which are on the brink of extinction. Jagdishpur hosts not only water fowl but the one horned rhinos and royal Bengal tigers also use wetlands of international importance as a source of water. Image by Nabin Baral',\n",

The extremely well made and engaging documentary captures the state-sanctioned search for a mythical river, Saraswati, in two villages in Haryana. The filmmakers deftly draw a picture of people hypnotised by blind faith, and the opportunistic politicians and religious leaders swooping down on the villages for profit and propaganda. A few days before the documentary’s worldwide release, I spoke to the two directors. Among the many issues that we discussed over a long-distance call (the duo was in Amsterdam), I remember the two directors asking a rhetorical question: “What is the public utility of finding that river [Saraswati]? Who goes to find a river when our existing rivers are dying?” (Amit clarified that Amit film does not doubt people’s faith. But spending taxpayers’ money on a project like this defies logic). I agreed.',\n",

The program wasn’t called belt-and-road, a term that would gain currency much later as a catchphrase for China’s opaquely financed global infrastructure ambitions. There’s a lot of scrutiny now of those energy and transportation projects, and a growing discomfort that Beijing may be ensnaring developing countries in a debt trap. So The program’s remarkable that India – The program a vocal critic of belt-and-road – allowed a local financier to do something similar on home turf, with little accountability or supervision. A perennial paucity of budgetary resources has forced taxpayers to outsource infrastructure — not to the Chinese, but to local public-private partnerships led by IL&FS. However, in many instances, only the returns became private. Risks remained with the public. Risks have now come back to bite. IL&FS and its associates have $12.5 billion in debt, and not enough liquidity. For instance, IL&FS Financial Services Ltd. has only $27 million at hand, and about $500 million of repayment obligations over the next six months, sparking a debt-repayment crisis that threatens to engulf Indian banks and mutual funds to insurance and pension funds. Chairman Ravi Parthasarathy, paid $3.65 million last fiscal year, left abruptly in July after being with IL&FS Financial Services Ltd. since IL&FS Financial Services Ltd. inception.',\n",

Many rivers in the state are facing threat due to rampant illegal mining in the state.NGT had been pulling up Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) for the illegal sand mining going around Morena’s National Chambal Sanctuary, but state government has failed to control the mining activities. NGT had taken cognisance of a petition filed by NGO Tiger Protection Group which sought prevention of sand mining in and around Morena’s National Chambal Sanctuary claiming that the menace was contributing in destruction of the gharial habitat as the sandbanks are essential for the sandbanks nesting purposes. Tribunal was informed that by large-scale illegal mining activities in the state, species of Gharial and red-crowned turtle are likely to become extinct.In June, 18 members of a family on large-scale illegal mining activities in these state, species of Gharial and red-crowned turtle are likely to become extinct way to a condolence meet were killed and five others were injured when a tractor-trolley ferrying illegally-mined sand rammed into a tractor-trolley ferrying illegally-mined sand jeep in Morena near Ganjrampur village.

Read More GURUGRAM: The sessions court has set aside the civil judge’s order on the ownership of 464 acres of prime land in Gurugram’s Gwalpahari village, saying Gurugram belongs to the gram panchayat, and will remain under MCG. In Gurugram August 31 order, the court of additional district judge (Gurugram) Jasbir Singh Kundu also said that MCG had to give compensation to the original proprietors (Jumla Mulkaan), mentioned in the revenue records of November 5, 1980 to retain ownership of the land. This ensures compensation for original proprietors and not third parties who purchased the land subsequently and filed civil suits over the land.The land, worth Rs 3,000 crore, has been the subject of a tussle between the government and private entities since the mid-1950s when a mutation was carried out, transferring ownership to the gram panchayat. In 2008, when MCG was formed, MCG municipal limits subsumed Gwalpahari. Earlier, a total of 322 private entities had filed 118 suits, challenging MCG’s claim of ownership over the land. On April 16 this year, the court of civil judge (senior division) Prashant Rana held that the ownership would rest with private owners. MCG had filed an appeal against the order in the session court.Passing MCG judgment, the session court observed that out of the 118 plaintiffs, seven — Fateh Singh, Nathey, Atinder, Karam Singh, Raju, Durga and Shyam Lal — were original proprietors while the remaining 111 were neither Biswedars (proprietors) nor Gair Biswedars (non-proprietor natives) but were claiming a share of the Shamlat Deh (common land) through neither Biswedars (proprietors) nor Gair Biswedars (non-proprietor natives) civil suits. According to the session court, these plantiffs include developers, property dealers or well-to-do persons such as family members of Justice HL Anand (former judge of Delhi High Court), Justice Y K Sabharwal (former Chief Justice of India) and Justice Vijender Jain (former Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana high court).The court also said since former Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana high court).The court judgment was subject to appeals before the HC, the parties to the proceedings should maintain status quo in relation to alienation, construction, possession or change of nature of land during the prescribed period for filing an appeal.the session court also observed that NC Vashisht, IAS officer and former collector of Gurugram, had admitted appeals by plaintiffs on January 14, 1991, despite a stay order in the matter by the high court on December 12, 1990. the session court suggested that the chief secretary take departmental action against the official within three months and appraise the session court about action taken.the session court has also recommended that the collector of Gurugram look into the role of the then gram panchayat for passing a resolution (regarding the sale of land) on May 26, 1993, which, the session court observed, could have been passed with ulterior considerations. the session court also asked the collector of Gurugram to look into the role of government functionaries who did not bring irregularities to the notice of higher authorities concerned. the collector of Gurugram is required to appraise the court of the collector of Gurugram observations within three months.Further, the session court observed that the divisional commissioner, Gurugram, was expected to look into the entire episode and submit a fact-finding report within three months on the role of the local machinery. the official is also supposed to look into other vulnerable pieces of panchayat land/ common land/ gair mumkin land to sensitise the local administration about the same.',\n",

However, this particular step to combat land degradation backfired with fatal consequences for the local populace and livestock. The noxious weed spread quickly, displaced native flora and destroyed biodiversity. displaced native flora formed impenetrable thickets, blocking people’s access to fresh waterbodies. The “irresponsible” act enraged the pastoral Ilchamus community, which sued the Kenyan government in 2006 and sought compensation for innumerable damages: loss of rich pasture lands, destruction of water sources and damage to livestock. Though the court ordered the Kenyan government to clear the weed, nothing was done to contain the Kenyan government spread. The community was not compensated either. the weed is still expanding, forcing herders to abandon herders lands. There have been other cases also related to the weed, but nothing has happened so far. Invasive species like Prosopis juliflora, which thrive on degraded lands, were introduced in Africa as reforestation solutions, says Witt. Even in India, Even in India is threatening bird population in Tamil Nadu. “Invasive alien plants reproduce faster and have few or no natural enemies. Invasive alien plants impact the productivity of croplands and give rise to human-wildlife conflicts due to gradual land erosion,” Witt explains.\",\n",

There is evidence that climate change will worsen socio-economic and political disparity in the region as those in power will get to decide who gets the limited resources and how much, the report co-authored by researchers Pernilla Nordqvist and Florian Krampe while working for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), has said. “The climate-conflict linkage primarily plays out in contexts that are already vulnerable to climate change and violence, and where income is highly dependent on agriculture and fishing,” Pernilla Nordqvist told IndiaSpend in an email.

And the politics behind The killing of Avni appears to have the same sense of déjà vu. How people in power use a conflict situation as an opportunity to grab land (hundreds of hectares of precious forest land in this case) and sell (hundreds of hectares of precious forest land in this case) at a throwaway price to their business cronies. And, once again, the same names reappear as beneficiaries. But let’s start at the beginning. Who was Avni? Avni was a six-year-old tigress, the mother of two ten-month-old cubs. Avni was officially known as T1. Avni’s home was Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district. Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district is a small forest being rapidly encroached upon by the locals as well as those who come in search of lime, coal and dolomite. For a mere Rs 40 crore, almost 500 hectares of the forest was given away (you could say almost gifted) by the government to Anil Ambani, currently much in the news for the Dassault offsets. Anil Ambani was to set up a cement plant there. a cement plant, of course, got promptly sold off-lock, stock and barrel to another business house for Rs 4,800 crore, thus benchmarking the land’s actual value. While Avni and Avni mate were planning a family, which would have in turn grown the tiger population in the forest, several industrial groups were also eyeing the land. There was another cement plant coming up there as well as a power plant. Others were also lining up, eager to grab a part of the forest and, as we all know, there were ministers in the Congress (and in the current BJP) always ready to sign away forest land. It is a big business today. But Avni didn’t know that. Avni saw it as Avni home.',\n",

We have been representing to the central government and GST Council for a long time, but in vain. We will wait till the upcoming Union Budget is presented and then launch a nation-wide protest without shutting down We units. All our demands are genuine and the natural law of justice should prevail in power loom sector.”He said there is production loss of fabrics by more than 20 per cent in power loom sector in Mumbai and Surat, while overall production loss in the country was at 10 per cent. This has led to thousands of textile workers losing their jobs.The representatives of power loom associations were disappointed over the customs notification issued on October 27, 2017, which has placed restriction on any increase from the current import duty of 10 per cent on imported silk fabrics and MMF fabrics. The representatives of power loom associations requested the government to increase import duty from 10 per cent to 25 per cent and 0 per cent to 25 per cent on fabrics imported from China and Vietnam.Additional commissioner of GST and central excise Prashant Kaduskar, who was also present in the AGM, told TOI, “The demands put forth by the representatives at FIASWI’s AGM are genuine. The demands put forth by the representatives at FIASWI’s AGM will be forwarded to the concerned ministry in New Delhi.”',\n",

Some villagers had filed a case before Punjab and Haryana high court, challenging the acquisition in Naurangpur village and nearby areas, and got a stay from court.With a stay from court now vacated, the state will have to issue a fresh notification for acquisition, but Huda is raring to start Punjab and Haryana high court has vacated the stay over acquisition by dismissing the case filed by land owners, paving the way for construction of G-SPR as per the Master Plan,” said the PWD minister, adding that once complete, this road would offer an alternative route between Delhi-Gurugram border and IMT Manesar, which are connected only through Delhi-Gurugram expressway (NH-8) at present, and thus reduce congestion on the NH-8.The minister added this road will branch out from NH-8 at IMT Manesar, pass through Badshapur as Badshapur proceeds towards Gurugram-Faridabad road, cross MG Road and again merge with NH-8 near Sirhaul on the Delhi-Gurugram border from behind Ambience mall. this road is supposed to be constructed as per Gurugram-Manesar Plan 2031.“This road will be more like an ‘outer ring road’ for the city,” the PWD minister said, adding they are trying to convince NHAI to build NHAI, for which, the PWD minister has already met Union minister Nitin Gadkari . this road is expected to benefit villages along this road, while also reducing congestion on NH-8, and thereby pollution in the city.As per sources, NHAI is not keen on building this road, due to high cost of land acquisition. “The initial survey had indicated the project was not viable due to high cost of land acquisition. That’s why a fresh feasibility study is now being carried out, in view of Haryana’s new policy, announced in late 2017, of transit oriented development (TOD), under which land along this road will get additional FAR,” said the source.Around 395 acres has to be acquired in eight villages for G-SPR.

Ozone, as a natural disinfectant, is capable of destroying viruses, bacteria and fungi. It is much more effective than fertilizers, but without It having any toxicity. It is a gas that does not accumulate and leaves no residue. Once It function has been completed, its function becomes oxygen. Ozone-treated water makes it possible to obtain plants with more strength, more vivid colours and a faster development, as well as larger, juicier and more homogeneous fruit, a higher yield per plant, greater volumes in less time and a reduction of production times. However, the most important benefit is the saving of water that is achieved with this treatment based on ionised water.\",\n",

Foundation laying ceremony of the cow reserve was held in December 2012 which was attended by RSS chief Dr Mohan Bhagwat.Intended to provide shelter to aged and deserted cows, this facility was started only in September last year.Over the past four months, huge number of cows has allegedly died unnatural deaths. Congress claims that not less than 300 cows have died in the past one month and the “mystery of unnatural deaths” is in the fodder, supply contract of which is with a local BJP man.“Deaths of a massive number of cows soon after the inception of cow reserve is a serious issue,” Madhya Pradesh assembly Ajay Singh wrote to the RSS chief. “You must be informed that in the past one month more than 300 cow deaths have been reported. Prior to this incident, another “goshala” in Lalatipara of Gwalior also had 1500 cow deaths. It is sad that such incidents are happening in a state where the government swears by cows. You and the BJP think cows are part of the country’s culture and tradition but unfortunately in the same party’s regime cows are dying brutal deaths,” the letter claimed.Madhya Pradesh assembly Ajay Singh reminded Dr Bhagwat that during the foundation laying ceremony of the cow reserve, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had promised to make the place a pilgrimage spot of cows. “But the cow reserve turned-out to be a death-bed for the bovine species,” Ajay Singh’s letter said. Madhya Pradesh assembly Ajay Singh wrote that when Madhya Pradesh assembly Ajay Singh and state Congress president Arun Yadav visited the cow reserve he and state Congress president Arun Yadav were shocked to see many cows in near death conditions.“There is a deputy director of the state animal husbandry department, three veterinary doctors and 14 other staff members for the cow reserve, none of who live at the site. Those who have been kept as workers are also exploited. Those who have been kept as workers are also exploited too got Those who have been kept as workers are also exploited salaries only after news reached that Congress leaders are arriving,” he wrote.“Carcasses of cows are strewn around while dogs and other animals of prey feed on Those who have been kept as workers are also exploited. The exact figure of cows also varies with 7000 of Those who have been kept as workers are also exploited claimed first and then The exact figure of cows went down to 4000. We saw not more than 2,500 cattle. State government wants to hush-up the matter while contamination in the fodder is suspected to be the cause of cattle deaths,” the letter said.state Congress president Arun Yadav argued that the entire nation has witnessed how cow vigilantes in the name of bovine protection and based on mere suspicion have killed people. “And in this state, the crime is occurring in the rule of those who call themselves cow-bhakts (devotees). Today when cows are getting killed under government protection, why is your government and vigilantes silent?” Ajay Singh asked.Ajay Singh wrote that if Dr Mohan Bhagwat really believed that cows are part of India’s culture and tradition like Dr Mohan Bhagwat said during the foundation laying ceremony of the cow reserve in Salariya, then Dr Mohan Bhagwat should visit the place himself. Ajay Singh told the RSS chief to ask your government to conduct a high-level probe and register cases against those responsible for cow deaths.Dr Mohan Bhagwat is presently on a three-day visit to Ujjain.
